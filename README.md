## What do you need to get started with the Twitter API

You need to [sign up](http://t.co/signup) for access to the Twitter API. You will also create a project in the [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and an App containing the credentials required to use the Twitter API. Additionally, you will need to have OAuth 2.0 turned on in your Appâ€™s authentication settings. The [developer playground](http://t.co/tryapi) is a great place to start using the Twitter API.
